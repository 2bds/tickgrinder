# Documentation
This is the main place where the platform's documentation is kept.  However, looking through it here directly is a bad idea since it's unformatted and unorganized!  Instead, launch the platform's MM and navigate to the "Docs" tab.

There, you can browse the entire collection of reference and documentation, search it for ideas you may want to learn about, and add your own notes to be indexed alongside it.
